You are a doctor. I will give you a dictionary mapping from biological and medical concepts to values.

Of the listed diagnoses guess what you think I have with percentage likelihood in parentheses.

Based on the most likely diagnosis, what should I do to confirm the diagnosis? Based on the most likely diagnosis, what would the treatment be?

Provide a link from Mayo Clinic that has information on the most likely diagnosis.

    ### Differential Diagnosis:
    
    1. **Asthma**
       - **Likelihood:** More likely
       - **Reasoning:** Given your family history of respiratory conditions and symptoms like shortness of breath and persistent cough, asthma is a possible diagnosis. Chest pain from coughing is also possible in asthmatic conditions.
       
    2. **Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)**
       - **Likelihood:** Less likely
       - **Reasoning:** Typically occurs in older individuals and often associated with smoking. However, it can present earlier especially if significant family history.
    
    3. **Pulmonary Embolism (PE)**
       - **Likelihood:** Less likely but potentially serious
       - **Reasoning:** PE could cause shortness of breath and chest pain; however, it is less common in young people without predisposing factors.
    
    4. **Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)**
       - **Likelihood:** Less likely
       - **Reasoning:** GERD can cause chronic cough and chest pain, but shortness of breath is less commonly associated.

    ### Recommended Action:
    
    - **Immediate Concerns:** If you experience severe symptoms such as severe chest pain or sudden shortness of breath, seek immediate medical attention at an emergency room.
    - **General Next Steps:** Schedule an appointment with your primary care provider for a physical examination and possible diagnostic tests.
    - **Conclusion:** Professional evaluation is crucial for an accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
